Entities designed:

i) ALU1, ALU2, ALU3: ALUs meant for arithmetic and logical operations. There is also an additional ALU4 inside EX stage, however it's code is not there in the Enitities folder exclusively.

ii) Branch_Jump_control: To control MUX9's output when branch or jump instructions happen.

iii) Data_memory: Memory block 2, used to store data

iv) Instruction_memory: Memory block 1, used to store instructions.

v) data_hazard_1, data_hazard_2, data_hazard_3: These blocks check for data dependencies and do the requisite data forwarding.

vi) Pipe_Register_control: To control the flow of information through the pipeline registers and stall the stages, as and when required.

vii) Register_file: Constains 16-bit registers from R0-R7.

viii) SE1: Sign extender for 1-bit data.

ix) SE6: Sign extender for 6-bit data.

x) SE9: Sign xtender for 9-bit data.

xi) Shifter: 1-bit left shifter.

xii) Stages: Contains the code required for each stage. Note that we do not need to design an entity for WB stage explicitly.
